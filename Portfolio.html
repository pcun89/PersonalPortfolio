                <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Scrabble - The Scrabble project revolves around processing data from a group of friends engaged in the game, utilizing dictionaries to organize players, words, and points efficiently. The initial phase establishes the 'letter_to_points' dictionary, employing list comprehension and zip to correlate letters with their point values, including consideration for blank tiles. The subsequent introduction of the 'score_word' function calculates the total points for a given word by iterating through its letters and accumulating their point values from the 'letter_to_points' dictionary. A test case, evaluating "BROWNIE," ensures the function's accuracy. The project progresses by creating 'player_to_words' and 'player_to_points' dictionaries, capturing players, their played words, and corresponding points. Through a nested loop, total points for each player are computed and the 'player_to_points' dictionary is updated accordingly. The final game standings, highlighting the leading player, are then printed. For additional practice, the project suggests implementing supplementary functionalities like the 'play_word()' function for adding words to a player's list and the 'update_point_totals()' function to streamline nested loops. There's also an invitation to enhance the 'letter_to_points' dictionary to accommodate lowercase inputs. In summary, this Scrabble project offers practical experience in working with dictionaries and functions in Python.</b>
